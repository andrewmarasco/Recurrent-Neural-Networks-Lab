# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) – Time Series Forecasting Lab

## Overview
This project explores the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically LSTM-based models, to forecast time-series data. The lab simulates a real-world scenario in which a renewable energy company needs to predict wind turbine power output to support maintenance planning and grid reliability.

## Objectives
- Prepare and clean time-series data for sequence modeling
- Create sliding windows suitable for RNN input
- Build and train an RNN/LSTM forecasting model
- Evaluate model performance using quantitative metrics and visualizations

## Workflow
1. Load and preprocess wind power time-series data  
2. Create fixed-length input sequences using sliding windows  
3. Build and train an LSTM-based RNN model  
4. Evaluate predictions using Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
5. Visualize predicted vs. actual power output

## Files
- `C10_M04_Lab.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing the full lab workflow, model training, and evaluation
- `README.md` – Project overview and context

## Key Concepts
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Time-series forecasting
- Sliding windows
- Model evaluation (MSE, visualization)

## Notes
This lab was completed as part of a data science curriculum focused on deep learning and sequence modeling. The emphasis is on understanding the end-to-end forecasting workflow rather than production optimization.
